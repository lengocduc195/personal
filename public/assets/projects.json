        "description": "Our research focuses on evaluating AI models using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques and identifying reasoning vulnerabilities. We develop systematic methods to assess the reliability, consistency, and interpretability of AI-generated explanations. Additionally, we investigate potential weaknesses in AI reasoning, uncovering biases, inconsistencies, and exploitable flaws. Our goal is to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of AI systems, ensuring their explanations are meaningful and reliable in real-world applications.",
